# Refactoring Plan for OpenManus (Version 3)

**Goal:** To establish OpenManus as a fully independent project by removing all dependencies on LangManus while maintaining and enhancing its core functionalities.

## Key Objectives

1. **Remove LangManus Dependencies**
   - Eliminate all direct and indirect imports from LangManus
   - Ensure all code paths are independent of LangManus components
   - Verify no residual LangManus references remain in configuration files

2. **Complete Rewrite of Core Components**
   - **Prompts System**
     - Rewrite all prompt templates in `/src/prompts/` to be OpenManus-specific
     - Implement custom prompt management system tailored to OpenManus needs
     - Add documentation for each prompt's purpose and usage
   
   - **Agent System**
     - Implement independent agent architecture based on LangGraph
     - Define clear interfaces and protocols for agent communication
     - Create OpenManus-specific agent roles and responsibilities
   
   - **Tools Integration**
     - Develop native tool implementations for OpenManus
     - Create unified tool interface and registration system
     - Implement robust error handling and logging

3. **Configuration and Infrastructure**
   - Implement OpenManus-specific configuration system
   - Set up proper dependency management
   - Create comprehensive testing framework

## Implementation Steps

1. **Dependency Audit (Priority: High)**
   - Scan codebase for LangManus imports and references
   - Document all instances of LangManus code usage
   - Create dependency removal tracking system

2. **Prompts Rewrite (Priority: High)**
   - Analyze current prompt templates functionality
   - Design OpenManus-specific prompt architecture
   - Implement new prompt templates with:
     - Clear role definitions
     - Specific task handling instructions
     - Error handling guidelines
     - Custom parameters and variables

3. **Agent System Implementation (Priority: High)**
   - Design agent communication protocols
   - Implement core agent classes:
     - Coordinator: Task distribution and workflow management
     - Planner: Strategy development and task breakdown
     - Executor: Task execution and resource management
     - Monitor: System health and performance tracking
   - Create agent lifecycle management system

4. **Tools Development (Priority: Medium)**
   - Create native implementations for:
     - File management system
     - Code execution environment
     - Web interaction tools
     - Data processing utilities
   - Implement tool registration and discovery system
   - Add tool usage monitoring and analytics

5. **Testing and Validation (Priority: High)**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Implement integration tests for agent interactions
   - Add performance benchmarking tools
   - Set up continuous integration pipeline

6. **Documentation and Standards (Priority: Medium)**
   - Create API documentation
   - Write development guidelines
   - Document system architecture
   - Create contribution guidelines

## Success Criteria

1. Zero references to LangManus in codebase
2. All components have OpenManus-specific implementations
3. Complete test coverage for core functionality
4. Documented API and architecture
5. Successful execution of all existing use cases

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Dependency Audit and Removal
- Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Prompts and Agents Rewrite
- Phase 3 (Week 3-4): Tools Development
- Phase 4 (Week 4-5): Testing and Documentation

## Risk Management

1. **Functionality Gaps**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing during each component rewrite
   - Fallback: Maintain parallel systems during transition

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing
   - Fallback: Optimize critical paths first

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Incremental changes with integration tests
   - Fallback: Rollback capability for each change

## Monitoring and Control

- Weekly progress reviews
- Automated testing for each component
- Performance benchmarking
- Code quality metrics tracking
